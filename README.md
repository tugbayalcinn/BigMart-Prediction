# BigMart-Prediction

This project aims to predict sales for BigMart stores using historical sales data and various machine learning techniques. The process includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to generate accurate sales predictions.

🔍 Project Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Handling missing values
Feature engineering
Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding
Built a regression model using XGBoost
Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
Evaluated model performance using error metrics
Predictions on test data

🛠 Technologies Used
Python
Pandas & NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn
Scikit-learn
XGBoost
Jupyter Notebook

📁 Files
BigMartSales_ML.ipynb – Complete notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
submission.csv – File with final predictions for test data.

✅ Notes
Categorical variables were encoded using LabelEncoder only.
The predictive model was built using XGBoost Regressor, with GridSearchCV applied to find the best parameters.
The final model was evaluated using metrics like RMSE and R² score.
